This is a mock-up of a portfolio of web applications that I have created. For this assignment, I have linked 3 actual external web pages of applications recently produced. There are additionally 2 placeholders for applications that do not exist to demonstrate a clickable link. 

The email address at the bottom of the page is clickable, opening up a new message to the displayed email address using the default email service of the user, and personal design site is a clickable redirect as well.

Copyright information is also listed at the bottom.
